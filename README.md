Berkeley City Map
It is a web mapping application inspired by the Google Maps team and the OpenStreetMap project from which the tile images and map feature data was downloaded. Here we are working with real-world mapping data here that is freely available - after finishing this project, we can even extend the code to support a wider range of features. The project support the back end - the web server that powers the API that the front end makes requests to.
